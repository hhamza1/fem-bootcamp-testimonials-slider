## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this testimonial slider and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to: 

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Navigate the slider using either their mouse/trackpad or keyboard


The challenge will be mainly using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
